ASYMPTOTIC ANALYSIS
--------------------

Asymptotics is a method of describing the limiting behaviour of a function.
Asymptotic analysis refers to defining the mathematical boundation of the run time performance based on the input size.

The Analysis can be done with 3 cases
1. Best Case (Omegha Notation)
2. Worst Case (Big - 0 Notation)
3. Average Case( Thetha Notation)

--------------------------------------------------

Omega (Ω) notation specifies the asymptotic lower bound for a function f(n). For a given function g(n), Ω(g(n)) is denoted by:

Ω (g(n)) = {f(n): there exist positive constants c and n0 such that 0 ≤ c*g(n) ≤ f(n) for all n ≥ n0}.

Follow the steps below to calculate Ω for a program:

1. Break the program into smaller segments.
2. Find the number of operations performed for each segment(in terms of the input size) assuming the given input is such that the program
   takes the least amount of time.
3. Add up all the operations and simplify it, let’s say it is f(n).
4. Remove all the constants and choose the term having the highest order or any other function which is always less than f(n) when n tends
   to infinity, let say it is g(n) then, Omega (Ω) of f(n) is Ω(g(n)).


---------------------------------------------------

Big-Theta(Θ) notation specifies a bound for a function f(n). For a given function g(n), Θ(g(n)) is denoted by:

Θ (g(n)) = {f(n): there exist positive constants c1, c2 and n0 such that 0 ≤ c1*g(n) ≤ f(n) ≤ c2*g(n) for all n ≥ n0}.

1. Break the program into smaller segments.
2. Find the number of operations performed for each segment(in terms of the input size) assuming the given input is such that the program
   takes the least amount of time.
3. Add up all the operations and simplify it, let’s say it is f(n).
4. Remove all the constants and choose the term having the highest order. Let say it is g(n) then, Omega (Θ) of f(n) is Θ(g(n)).


---------------------------------------------------

Big – O Notation:

Big – O (O) notation specifies the asymptotic upper bound for a function f(n). For a given function g(n), O(g(n)) is denoted by:

O (g(n)) = {f(n): there exist positive constants c and n0 such that f(n) ≤ c*g(n) for all n ≥ n0}.

Follow the steps below to calculate O for a program:

1. Break the program into smaller segments.
2. Find the number of operations performed for each segment (in terms of the input size) assuming the given input is such that the program
   takes the maximum time i.e the worst-case scenario.
3. Add up all the operations and simplify it, let’s say it is f(n).
4. Remove all the constants and choose the term having the highest order because for n tends to infinity the constants and the lower order terms in f(n) will be insignificant,
   let say the function is g(n) then, big-O notation is O(g(n)) or O(h(n)) where h(n) has higher order of growth than g(n)
